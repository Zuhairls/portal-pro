# PRO Portal Flagging System

This project was developed as part of the Summer Student Test for Touchstone Institute. The goal was to design and implement a prototype that improves the automatic flagging system used to review candidate applications for Practice Ready Ontario.

##  Overview

The system evaluates applicants based on criteria such as NAC exam score, MCCQE1 score, Canadian experience, and recent practice history. Based on this input, the system flags potential eligibility concerns using a customizable rule engine.

The final version includes both frontend and backend components with a working API, real-time flagging logic, and a clean user interface for reviewers to interact with and override flags if necessary.

##  Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Frontend**: AngularJS 1.x, PrimeNG
- **Persistence**: Mock local storage (via `localStorage`)
- **Tools**: Postman, Live Server (for local frontend preview), Git, VS Code

##  How to Run

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
